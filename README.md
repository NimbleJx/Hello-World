# Hello-World
Fuck, "Hello World!" My first code will greet me with all the hilarity of good airport banter. Just kidding. Don't want the TSA getting their knickers in a knot. My initial creation will speak to me, Jx. It, and all who use 'it' will regard me as... (alpha & omega, yes?)
My next project will get it right... Why can't I just delete this one?
